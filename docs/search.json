    "text": "Virtually all of the proteins present in either milk or whey can be recovered using ultrafiltration. The ‚Äômolecular weight cut-off‚Äô (MWCO) determines which molecules will be blocked from passing through the membrane. The smallest protein in both cases is Œ±‚àílactalbumin, which has a MW of 14 kDa. It is thus sufficient to select a MWCO that will ensure that this smallest protein does not permeate, as it follows logically that the larger proteins will not permeate if this condition is met. In the dairy industry the term ‚Äùultrafiltration‚Äù can often be taken to refer to a filtration process in which all of the proteins are recovered.\nThere are three streams to consider during any filtration process: the feed, retentate and permeate. During filtration the feed is separated into the retentate and permeate. In a benchtop process the retentate is commonly recirculated back to the feed, which becomes increasingly concentrated over time. As permeate volume (\\(P_V\\)) increases the feed volume (\\(F_V\\)) decreases. Typically there is a target volume concentration factor (\\(VCF\\)) that can be used to estimate the increase in protein content in the feed but also to set a limit on the process:\n\\[VCF = \\frac{F_v}{F_v - P_v}\\]\nHence, if you start with \\(1 \\ L\\) of feed, generate \\(670 \\ mL\\) of permeate you will have achieved a \\(VCF\\) of \\(3√ó\\). If the starting protein concentration was \\(3\\%\\) the concentration afterwards would be roughly \\(3 \\ √ó \\ 3 = 9\\). An efficient filtration process is one that has a high permeate flux that is sustainable over time. Flux is the flow-rate of permeate per unit of mem- brane area and typically has the units \\(L \\ m^{‚àí2} \\ h^{‚àí1}\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConverting Flow Data\n\n\n\nConsider that you have measured \\(10 \\ mL\\) of permeate in \\(30 \\ seconds\\) and the membrane area used was \\(0.1 \\ m^2\\):\n\\(mL\\) to \\(L\\) : 10 √∑ 1000 = 0.01\n\\(L \\ 30s^{‚àí1}\\) to \\(L \\ h^{‚àí1}\\) : 0.01 √ó 2 √ó 60 = 1.2\n\\(L h^{‚àí1}\\) to \\(L \\ m^{‚àí2} \\ h^{‚àí1}\\) : 1.2 √∑ 0.1 = 12\nThe answer is:\n\\[12 \\ L \\ m^{-2} \\ h^{-1}\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPermeate Viscosity\n\n\n\nThe viscosity of permeate generated during the ultrafiltration of milk or whey is low (similar to water). However, minor changes in permeate viscosity associated with temperature can have a significant effect on permeate flux.\n\n\n\n\n\nMost membrane operations in the dairy industry involve cross-flow filtration, which is distinct from the dead-end filtration that you are familiar with from your laboratories. In the lab when you are normally filtering a solution the feed liquid flows perpendicularly towards the membrane surface (think about it for a moment). While this works fine in the lab for small solutions it is often impractical at a commercial scale. The reason is fouling, the deposition of material on the surface of the membrane over time, which reduces the rate at which the liquid permeates the membrane and, thus, the speed of the process. In cross-flow filtration the feed liquid flows across or parallel to the membrane surface. If the pump is set to a value that ensures that the feed liquid is flowing with a high velocity then material that would normally deposit on the membrane surface will be continuously removed. This works pretty well and gives far superior performance to perpendicular flow; however, it isn‚Äôt perfect and gradual fouling is still a problem, making this an ongoing issue in dairy processing. When attempting to develop strategies to maximise permeate flux it is useful to consider Darcy‚Äôs equation:\n\\[J = \\frac{TMP}{\\mu \\cdot R}\\]\n\\(J\\) signifies flux (probably because \\(F\\) is taken), \\(TMP\\) stands for Trans Membrane Pressure, \\(¬µ\\) for permeate viscosity and \\(R\\) for hydraulic resis- tance. To generate permeate a pressure drop must exist from the feed-side to the permeate-side, which is done by closing a valve on the feed-side at the retentate line. Ideally, the highest TMP should be chosen in the pressure- dependant region of the J‚àíTMP curve; this means that if you adjusted the pressure in stepwise increments you would find a linear region that eventually transitions into a plateau - the idea is to select the TMP before that plateau is reached, as the plateau is associated with high degrees of fouling. Permeate viscosity is easy to manipulate. Most liquids decrease in viscosity as temperature increases, as the increased thermal energy is converted into kinetic energy that allows the molecules to move with more freedom. This is true unless a qualitative change occurs, such as when proteins aggregate to form larger structures that impart different viscosity properties. For these reasons a temperature ‚âà 50¬∞C has been common for filtration processes in the dairy industry (not too low, not too high). Declines in flux during filtration are common and typically caused by fouling of the membrane surface. The results in an increase in hydraulic resistance (\\(R\\) in Darcy‚Äôs equation). Fouling is a complex phenomenon which can be simply understood as the deposition of molecules at the surface of the membrane and, in some cases, inside the membrane pores themselves. An advantage of cross-flow filtration is that the feed material moves across the membrane surface during pumping, which contributes to the continuous removal of the fouling layer during filtration - this is not perfect, however.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRetentate Viscosity\n\n\n\nRetentate viscosity can increase substantially during ultrafiltration due to the concentration of protein. The increase viscosity can reduce cross-flow velocity and turbulence, which can contribute to fouling.\n\n\n\n\n\nA somewhat counter-intuitive finding in recent years is that operating filtration plants at close to refrigeration temperatures can have benefits for ensuring more sustainable flux values. The mechanism behind this is unclear at this point but what is apparent is that sacrificing the high initial fluxes associated with warm filtration can result in longer process runs, less down-time and reduced cleaning costs. It is not all good news, however, as larger pumps may be required to handle the more viscous feed material and there may also be associated refrigeration costs. Thus, there are trade-offs.\nAn interactive 3D model of the benchtop filtration system used at UCC can be found below:\n\n \n\nA real-life demonstration can also be found on Canvas.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnti-fouling\n\n\n\nMembrane fouling is a continued problem in the dairy industry. Scientists and engineers are investigating multiple approaches to minimise this phenomenon, such as:\n\nSpacer meshes that promote internal turbulence\nMembrane polymers that repel depositing molecules\nUltrasonicators that actively disrupt fouled material\nLow temperature operation for longer run times"

    "text": "One of the factors that maintain casein micelles in a suspended form in milk is their net negative charge (i.e., ‚Äúlike charges repel‚Äù). As milk is acidified the proportion of negative charges decrease and the proportion of positive charges in crease. At pH 4.6 milk is considered to have a net charge of zero, meaning there is a balance of the two types of charges. If these conditions are met micelles can no longer remain physically apart and tend to interact, gradually forming larger particles and eventually a coagulum. There are many terms used for this observed phenomenon, such as ‚Äôclotting‚Äô, ‚Äôgelling‚Äô and ‚Äôcoagulation‚Äô but they are all effectively synonymous, meaning the formation of a cohesive macroscopic mass.\n\n\n\n\nThe gelled material can then be easily separated from the liquid whey using coarse filters or decanter centrifuges. The two materials that results are acid casein and acid whey. After the whey is removed and the casein washed a fairly pure protein ingredient is collected; however, in many cases it isn‚Äôt very useful because of its insolubility. Making this material soluble again is easy, at least in principle. If we acidified the system to reduce the negative charge we just have to alkalise the system to restore the negative charge. This is how acid casein ‚Äî an insoluble ingredient ‚Äî is turned into caseinate, a soluble ingredient. One challenge with this part of the process is that the solubilisation in alkali is very slow, as the alkali must diffuse through the gel particles. What helps in this case is a high input of kinetic energy and an increase in the surface area of the particles - this is achieved with high-shear mixing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAcid Casein & Sodium Caseinate at Home\n\n\n\nIt is possible to make acid casein quiet easily. The material that is formed is similar to a fresh cheese.\n\nAdd 400 mL of skim milk to a pot and heat until boil\nTake milk off heat for 1-2 minutes or until T = 50 ‚ó¶ C\nAdd 1-2 tablespoons of lemon juice or vinegar\nStir acidified milk until visual clotting is apparent\nFilter clotted milk through cheesecloth or a colander\nPour water over recovered material to wash out impurities\nWeigh the casein and whey.

    "text": "Next Practical\n\n\n\nThe next practical is dedicated to the principles underlying the rennet coagulation of milk, so only a brief outline of the principles as they pertain to ingredient development will be provided here.\n\n\n\nA\n\nThe basic process for making rennet casein broadly resembles that of acid casein. Both could be described in general as follows:\n\nWarming of milk\nAddition of coagulant\nCooking/incubation\nWhey separation\nWashing\nDrying\n\nThe coagulation in this case relies on the proteolytic activity of rennet, or more specifically chymosin, the main proteolytic enzyme present in rennet. When milk is renneted the \\(\\kappa\\)-casein at the surface of the casein micelles is hydrolysed, releasing the hydrophilic fragment of this casein molecule into the serum phase. This phenomenon is more rapid at a temperature of 32¬∞C because this is the optimal temperature of the enzymes involved. Incubation at this temperature for about 15‚àí20 minutes is required to release around 80% of the \\(\\kappa\\)-casein into the serum, which is sufficient for destabilisation and coagulation of the casein.\nFollowing coagulation the temperature if typically elevated to 60¬∞C for two reasons:\n\nDeactivation of enzymes (to prevent quality loss during production)\nPromotion of coagulation (by enhancing hydrophobic interactions be- tween caseins)\n\nIf only a weak coagulum is formed during this stage then the separation of curds and whey won‚Äôt be efficient, i.e., there will be transfer of fine casein curd particles into the whey. This is why in both acid casein and rennet casein manufacture it is essential to promote curd fusion in a cooking step. There is no equivalent to sodium caseinate for rennet casein - alkalising rennet casein with something like sodium hydroxide would be ineffective because pH wasn‚Äôt responsible for the solubility change in the first place.\n\n\n\n\nAcid Casein\nRennet Casein\nSodium Caseinate\n\n\n\n\nSoluble in\nalkali\nchelator\nwater\n\n\n[CCP]\nlow\nhigh\nlow\n\n\n[Sodium]\nlow\nlow\nhigh\n\n\nApplication\nprecursor\ncheese analogues\nvarious\n\n\n\nRennet casein is used as is in the manufacture of cheese analogues, but this application does require solubilisation to be carried out in a different manner. In analogue cheese dissolved rennet casein functions to emulsify oil droplets and form a cohesive cheese-like mass. To solubilise rennet casein so-called ‚Äùemulsifying salts‚Äù are used. This term is a bit confusing, as the salts do not emulsify the casein but rather modify the casein so that the casein can function as an emulsifier. The emulsifying salts are typically calcium chelators, like trisodium citrate, which bind to calcium ions from the rennet casein, upsetting the delicate equilibrium between the calcium in the CCP and in the serum phase. Ultimately, the CCP is completely dissolved, which seems to reduce the integrity of the insoluble rennet casein particles (you will see this process in action in a later lab.)"

    "text": "Although the focus in this practical is on the casein ingredients developed by precipitation, it should be remembered that each process generates a whey stream. The properties of the whey stream is fundamentally shaped by the specific casein production process used. As acidification almost completely solubilises the colloidal calcium phosphate (CCP) associated with the casein micelles during acid casein manufacture acid whey is far more enriched in minerals than rennet whey, as the latter is not subject to acidification, keeping the CCP mostly intact. Logically, it follows that the rennet casein itself is more heavily mineralised than the acid casein. The presence of additional minerals in the acid whey often creates problems during the manufacture of other ingredients (e.g., whey powders, WPCs) as the calcium phosphate in particular can become insoluble during whey processing. However, these minerals can also be recovered as a valuable ingredient known simply as ‚Äùmilk minerals‚Äù.\nüìö Book chapter on milk minerals as an ingredient (accessible with UCC student account)\nA final remark should be made about the fate of the fragments of Œ∫- casein that are liberated during renneting (though not acidification). These fragments are known as ‚Äùglycomacropeptide‚Äù or ‚ÄùGMP‚Äù for short. This name simply means a big (macro) string of amino acids (peptide) that is glycosylated (glyco). Rennet whey is rich in GMP, and some companies fractionate this material to create nutritional products for the treatment of phenylketonuria (PKU), a condition in which afflicted individuals have issues consuming protein in the diet, more specifically foods containing the amino acid phenylalanine (which GMP is very low in).\nüìö Free article on the use manufacture and use of GMP in nutritional management of PKU\nWhen you are thinking about these materials you should always think of what properties are being exploited to produce them, how the process used impacts the different streams that are generated, and how some of these changes can form the basis of further innovation."
